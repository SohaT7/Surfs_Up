# An Analysis of Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis
### Description of the Project:
This project [Surfs_Up_Challenge](https://github.com/SohaT7/Surfs_Up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb) retrieves and analyzes weather data for the months of June and December.

### Purpose of the Analysis:
The purpose of this statistical analysis on the weather data is to determine if the weather is suitable for starting a Surf 'n Shake shop, a shop selling ice cream and surf boards to the locals, tourists, and other visitors in Oahu, Hawaii. This information is needed for the investor(s) to decide whether they are willing to chip in their money into this project. If this venture is successful, it has the potential to be expanded to other cities in Hawaii too.

# An Analysis of Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis
### Description of the Project:
This project [Surfs_Up_Challenge](https://github.com/SohaT7/Surfs_Up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb) retrieves and analyzes weather data, from the [hawaii.sqlite database](https://github.com/SohaT7/Surfs_Up/blob/main/hawaii.sqlite), for the months of June and December.

### Purpose of the Analysis:
The purpose of this statistical analysis on the weather data is to determine if the weather is suitable for starting a Surf 'n Shake shop, a shop selling ice cream and surf boards to the locals, tourists, and other visitors in Oahu, Hawaii. This information is needed for the investor(s) to decide whether they are willing to chip in their money into this project. If this venture is successful, it has the potential to be expanded to other cities in Hawaii too. 

## Results
The summary statistics for the weather data from June and December is, respectively, shared below:

![December](https://github.com/SohaT7/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Image_December_Temperatures.png)

The three key differences in the weather between June and December are as follows:
- The minimum temperature in the month of June is 64 degrees, whereas the minimum temperature in the month of December is 8 degrees lower, at 56 degrees. The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees, whereas in December it is only 2 degrees lower, at 83 degrees.
- The median temperature in June is 75 degrees, whereas the median temperature in December is 71 degrees. 
- The mean temperature in June is around 74.9 degrees, with a standard deviation of about 3.26. The mean temperature in December is about 71 degrees, with a standard deviation of about 3.7.

## Summary
### High level summary of the results:
The temperature counts we have in our dataset for June are 1700, as opposed to 1517 for December. The mean temperature in June is about 74.9 degrees (with a standard deviation of around 3.26), whereas it is 71 degrees in December (with a standard deviation of about 3.75). The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and the maximum is 85 degrees, i.e. the range of temperature in June (range = max - min) is 21 degrees. The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, whereas it is 83 degrees in December, i.e. the range of temperature in December (range = max - min) is 27 degrees. The median temperature in June is 75 degrees, and the interquartile range (3rd Quartile - 1st Quartile = 77 - 73) is 4 degrees. The median temperature in December is 71 degrees, and the interquartile range (3rd Quartile - 1st Quartile = 74 - 69) is 5 degrees. 

### Additional Queries that can be performed:
We can perform additional queries to find more weather data for June and December. 
First, we can run a query on precipitation rates in June and December, to gauge how much it rains (or snows) in Oahu. A rainy day does not make for an ideal day to go surfing, and so this analysis can prove quite useful! 
Second, we can run a query on humidity, or wind speeds and directions, or even tidal wave levels, to gauge if the weather during June and December will be favorable for being out and about surfing and having ice cream!
